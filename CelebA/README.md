# CelebA Data

## Image Data

You can find the original version of the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset), but we pre-align all faces.
You can download the [Pre-aligned Faces of the CelebA dataset](https://seafile.ifi.uzh.ch/f/5853d95aef724bafa868) and extract them here.

## Protocol Files

Some of the protocol files listed here are taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset):

* list_attr_celeba.txt
* list_eval_partition.txt

Some other files have been created by ourselves, basically listing the frontal faces contained in the training and validation set:

* aligned_224x224_test_filtered_0.1.txt
